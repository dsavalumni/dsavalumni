            <h2>Our Story and Vision</h2>
            <p>Established in 1949, Debagram Shibram Anandamayee Vidyapith has nurtured generations of students with a strong foundation in academics, values, and community spirit. Our Alumni Association was formed to honor this legacy, bridging the past and present by uniting former students under a common banner. We believe in fostering lifelong connections, giving back to our alma mater, and strengthening the bond between alumni, current students, and the broader school community.</p>
